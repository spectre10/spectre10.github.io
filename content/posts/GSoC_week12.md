## What did I do in this period?

In this week, I sent and iterated on [t-urlmatch-normalization](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20240820152008.21354-2-shyamthakkar001@gmail.com/). After the review process, the v4 is ready to be merged to master.

Other than that, I wasn't able to do much because I was in the process of moving to a different city due to me starting at a new job.

## What is the plan ahead?

So, basically this was the last week of my Google Summer of Code Program. However,
I will still send and iterate on [t-oid-array](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20240803132206.72166-1-shyamthakkar001@gmail.com/) and [t-oidset](https://github.com/spectre10/git/commit/68e8ee1c7aa1ca7d1996498518bd9a0366372f33). I also
want to say that it has been an absolutely wonderful experience working with
[Christian](https://gitlab.com/chriscool) and [Kaartic](https://github.com/sivaraam). They have been very helpful and attentive in
resolving my doubts and reviewing my patches beforehand.

Thanks!
